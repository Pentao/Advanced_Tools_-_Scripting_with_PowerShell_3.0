# Advanced Tools & Scripting with PowerShell 3.0

Since I couldn’t find the supporting scripts for this online session, I decided to publish my own notes here at GitHub. 

The support materials for the “Advanced Tools & Scripting with PowerShell 3.0” jumpstart, originally published in Microsoft MVA don't seem to be available anywhere. 

Further to the closure of this platform, the videos were migrated to Channel 9, you can find them here: https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/advpowershell3
